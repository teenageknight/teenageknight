## Hi there, I'm Bryce Jackson ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a kid who loves CS, who fell in love with it making Minecraft Mods and bricking the family computer. I have made it all the way for they pay me to do this for a living (hopefully for a while as long as AI doesnt take my job :( Check out this repo for my latest side project, but to be honest most of my stuff is in private repos.
